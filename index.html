      and emerges from a lineage of people addressing colonial violence through architectural and interdisciplinary theory and methods. Their works engage with images, with testimonies, with materiality, assemblages of concepts, and profound attunement to detail. They are concerned with the nuance and importance of visual presentation as a tool; their work is dimensional and spatial in theory and content; they are transparent about their processes and make their tools, sources, and methods accessible to others. They push the boundaries of their practices, prioritize marginalized experiences, and make room for nuance. I hope my work will be imbued with all of these qualities.

      Drawing on some aspects of my precedent study, I’m interested in examining and exploring ecocide in Gaza and the West Bank. I’m interested in working across scales—in looking at soil toxified through military invasion, at aerial photographs and satellite images.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing I found compelling about the methods used for ‘A Cartography of Genocide’ is that they integrated the granularity of data points with a meta-analysis of the military’s invasion and patterns of deliberate violence across aspects of life.

      While my visualizations will certainly take a different form, I am interested in counter cartographies and layers as a method or mode of analysis.

      In terms of the colloquium theme, I’m interested in situating technology in its historical, political, and material contexts. I’m intrigued by the concept of ‘situatedness’ on micro and macro levels, along with Forensic Architecture’s theoretical theory of aesthetic sensing, thresholds of visibility, and minute observing.

      In terms of methods, I am interested in exploring materialities, creative cartographies, topographical lines, ecological transformations (can fermentation be political? Can burning? Can growth?), through art, through investigation, through repetition, through writing, through mapping, through sensing of all kinds.
    </p>
    <p>
      More specifically I am interested in GIS, in composites of satellite images, in LiDAR, projectors, the interplay between the digital and non digital. My work will likely be qualitative, focusing on aesthetic, material, and written processes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my process, methods are usually preceded by theory; I want to find the technologies that correspond to the ideas I am exploring.

      As for my work this semester, my project for Computational Design Modeling explores perception, lived experience, memory and the built environment. I’m working on a model that triggers the visualization of the buildings around it as a point moves through space, reflecting on the ways in which our reality is shaped by what we notice around us.

      I am interested in sequencing, diptychs, and visual narration. I want to experiment with how design can be so fully imbued with theory. I am invested in the aesthetic properties of land and their roles in settler colonialism. I believe in and am critical of images. I am curious about sound. I am sometimes intrigued by the physicality of the digital (the pixel) (granularity). I am prone to loving beautiful things, elegance, delicate objects, organic forms, tendrils, accidental moments of composition, precision, and simplicity. I am interested in layers, both vertical and horizontal, assemblages, and mapping connections. I relate to the world and my intellectual work in visual, tactile, auditory, and linguistic ways. I am invested in the narratives that are revealed through marginalized modes of sensing, and the ways in which sensing, as a process, is visualized. I am curious about pixelated and pointal representations, including film and digital photographs and LiDAR. I am intrigued by the idea of photos not meant for the human eye.

      Although I am sometimes pessimistic about the impact and importance of my work, there is a persistent part of me that believes that researching violence on large and small scales in Palestine is deeply important. Perhaps one of the rhetorical arguments of my work is that making both acts of violence and determined acts of resistance visible—literally and abstractly—might play a small part in Palestinian liberation.

      I know I will come up against limitations in my technical skills as I pursue this project, and I know that I will need to look towards my classmates and the GSAPP community when I get stuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Part of me feels as though it’s impossible for me, as I am now, to imagine what I will ultimately produce because it will involve theory I have not yet read, techniques I have not yet familiarized myself with, and perhaps a whole methodology I have yet to discover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, I can see myself coming up against feelings of futility and questions about the purpose or impact of my work. As I write these words there are people experiencing dire conditions of hunger and terror, and I don’t know what to do. And I know I can only keep going.
